ArcGis Map Application
This is a new project by a first time programmer to build a simple mobile map app for ArcGIS.  My name is Joey Lowe and I'm a self-taught programmer with some experience with Python, Ruby on Rails and HTML5.  I have a basic idea of what I want the map app to do.  This app isn't for everyone.  The target audience is for local government.
